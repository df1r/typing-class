            <p class="random-text" id="goal-text">In geology, a dike or dyke is a sheet of rock that is formed in a fracture of a pre-existing rock body. Dikes can be either magmatic or sedimentary in origin. Magmatic dikes form when magma flows into a crack then solidifies as a sheet intrusion, either cutting across layers of rock or through a contiguous mass of rock. Clastic dikes are formed when sediment fills a pre-existing crack.</p>

Notable ureilites are the Novo Urei and the Goalpara, also named for the town in which it landed (Goalpara, Assam India).
